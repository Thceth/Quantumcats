Here's a brief summary of OP_CAT based on the information in the email thread 
@ https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/022049.html

Key Points:

-OP_CAT is a proposed opcode (operation code) for Bitcoin Script.
-It would enable concatenation (joining together) of two values on the script stack.
-It was previously disabled in Bitcoin due to potential security concerns.
-There's renewed interest in reintroducing it with carefully considered limitations.

Potential Applications:

-Covenants: Constraints on how bitcoins can be spent in the future.
-SPV Proof Verification: Enhancing security of lightweight Bitcoin clients.
-Protection Against Double-Spends: Preventing unauthorized spending of unconfirmed transactions.
-Making BitVM More Efficient: Potentially improving performance of certain Bitcoin virtual machines.
-Arithmetic With Large Numbers: Enabling complex calculations on the blockchain.
-Creation of Vaults and Quantum-Resistant Signatures: Supporting advanced security features.

Considerations and Challenges:

-Script Size Limits: Preventing excessively large or resource-intensive scripts.
-Potential Vulnerabilities: Carefully addressing past security concerns.
-Community Consensus: Gaining approval from Bitcoin developers and users for a change in Bitcoin Script.

Current Status:

-Under Discussion: Actively debated in the Bitcoin development community.
-No Final Decision: Not yet implemented in Bitcoin Core.

Additional Insights from the Email Thread:

-Specific Proposals for Implementation: Detailed suggestions for how OP_CAT could be safely integrated.
-Reference Implementation: A link to a working code example for reference.
